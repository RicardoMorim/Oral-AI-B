# Oral-AI-B

This is a website i made for AI b
This was made with the purpose of supporting me during my oral speech, we did not learned how to code, i learned alone at home, so im the only one doing one of these.
Here i talk about C, Python, SQL, Js, HTML, CSS (i know HTML and CSS aren't considered languages tho, i simply find them too important to simply not talk about), C++ and Java.
The animations and the ribbons were taken from:
